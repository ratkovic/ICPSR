# ICPSR Bayes II

Welcome to Bayes II at ICPSR!

I will be passing material to you through the overleaf and this github.  The material on the overleaf can be accessed through this 
 [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ttrwjfsxxzjf).  The syllabus, lecture notes, readings, and other materials can be found in the overleaf.

The assignment can be accessed in the notebook above. The first one is designed to run in R, though we will have work in Python later in the semester.

We will spending some time on this course in Large Language Models, and it is always easier to illustrate rather than describe their power.  As a taste, go to openAI at [openai.com](openai.com)  and sign up if you have not. Then, navigate to chatGPT and enter the following into the prompt:

> My professor has assigned us an assignment that is located as an ipython notebook (.ipynb) on his github.   The file is located at https://github.com/ratkovic/ICPSR/blob/main/ProblemSet1.ipynb.  How can I open up the file via google colab on my own? You can assume I have a google account already.[

I am going to be encouraging you to use chatGPT, or GitHub copilot if you'd prefer, to build your code through this course, so before you ask me a coding question, be sure to try chatGPT first!
