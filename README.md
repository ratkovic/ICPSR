# ICPSR Bayes II

Welcome to Bayes II ICPSR!

I will be passing material to you through the overleaf and this github.  The material on the overleaf can be accessed through this 
 [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ttrwjfsxxzjf).


My professor has assigned us an assignment that is located as an ipython notebook (.ipynb) on his github.   The file is located at https://github.com/ratkovic/ICPSR/blob/main/ProblemSet1.ipynb.  How can I open up the file via google colab on my own? You can assume I have a google account already.[
